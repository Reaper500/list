        <h1>Quick hummus recipe</h1>

  <p>This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing.</p> 
  
  It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years.

  Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes.
    
    <p>Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes.</p> 
  
  It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.

  <h1>Ingredients</h1>
<ul>
    <li>1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)</li>
    <li>of tahini</li>
    <li>6 sundried tomatoes</li>
    <li>Half a red pepper</li>
    <li>A pinch of cayenne pepper</li>
    <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
    <li>A dash of olive oil</li>>
</ul>
  

 <h1> Instructions</h1>
<ol>
  <li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely</li>
  <li>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely</li>
  <li>Add all the ingredients into a food processor</li>
  <li>Process all the ingredients into a paste</li>
  <li>If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time</li>
  <li>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time</li>
  </ol>

  <p>For a different flavor, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese.</p> 
  
  Experiment and see what works for you.

  Storage

  Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it. 
  
  If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.

  Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.

  <h1>Important notice</h1>
<p>On Sunday January 9th 2010, a gang of goths were
  spotted <strong>stealing</strong> several garden gnomes from a
  shopping center in downtown <em>Milwaukee</em>. They were
  all wearing <strong>green</strong> jumpsuits and silly hats, and
  seemed to be having a whale of a time. If anyone
   has any <em>information</em> about this incident, please
    contact the <strong>police</strong> now.</p>
